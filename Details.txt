  Database:

    what is DB?
      A database is an organized collection of structured/unstructed information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

      Structured:
        SQL --> Structured Query Language

        DBs > Tables > Rows, Columns > Datatypes( INT, VARCHAR, FLOAT, BLOB, TEXT) 

      Entities:
      
        whatsapp like application:
          status ( something in status, createdTime, seenPeople, replys )
          chatbox( isGroup true/false, members [],    ) > messages/chats ( text, isMedia true/false, time, seen true/false, isSent true/false)
          users ( phone, name, email, profile)
        
        Instagram:
          posts ( text, isMedia, postedTime, likes, dislikes )
          users ( phone, name, email, profile, isPrivate, following [] )

        One <-> Many
          user <-> comments
          user <-> posts

        Many <-> Many ( most probably will be converted to a one <-> many )
          classes <-> students
          subjects <-> students

        Movies

    basics:
      datatypes in sql
        basic types 
          varchar(size) - string, 
          INT(size), 
          FLOAT(size, d), 
          DATE
          BLOB(size) / TEXT (CDN URL)- images/vidoes
            usually not suggested to used because of the uncertain size and type of the media which can load the DB size.
            Preferred way is CDN ( Content Delivery Network ) which can serve the images or videos hover internet

      translates the sql into CRUD operation instructions

    MySQL: ( DBMS Application  )

      Mysql

    MySql Engine:
      Whichs lets use store any sort datatypes from  DBMS to the actual memory
